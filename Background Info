Hello, my name is Braden Smith. I am a current student at Mizzou seeking a degree in I.T. I was born in Columbia Missouri on March 10th, 2001.
I originally went to school in Columbia but later moved to a small town north of Columbia. This town is named Centralia, this is where I graduated Highschool from.
